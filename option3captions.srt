1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,440
so I'm not sure that this is a complete

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,200
solution I'm pretty confident it's not

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,280
but I do see a lot of potential for the

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,759
future if we were to take this in our

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,360
own Direction I think uh Amazon's

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,839
interactive video service has a lot of

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,600
challenges with it it's really designed

8
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,039
for live streaming and what we would

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,000
actually have to do is uh push our

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,000
pre-recorded videos in through a live

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,599
streaming service to have them record on

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,279
the IVs site total pain uh where I'm

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,160
hoping we can be able to go with this

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,079
eventually is uh setting up a guey to

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,879
easily edit the different components of

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,879
the video the buttons that kind of thing

17
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,800
without uh having to deal with the

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,320
coding and I also see the potential down

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,160
the road for us to be able to create

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,160
Dynamic buttons uh based on where the

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,160
user is coming from or uh other

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,039
variables that we might be able to

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,039
capture uh so that's

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,039
it
